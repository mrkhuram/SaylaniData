to handle multi part form .... we need to install multer....
if form in not in multi part then multer cannot handle the form...
we need to specify that form is multipart..
by
<form enctype = "multipart/form-data"

install multer ... npm install multer...
import multer...
multer = require('multer')
upload = multer ({dest: 'uploads/'})


....
1-	create form...
2-	import multer	
to select multi files.... use multifile attribute in the input field...

and then.... change the upload.single to upload.array....
also change its name in the config.... by adding math.random() method....
